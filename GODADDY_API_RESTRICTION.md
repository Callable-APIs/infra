# GoDaddy API Access Restriction

## The Problem

**GoDaddy has implemented restrictions on API access as of April 2024:**

- ❌ **Accounts with fewer than 10 domains** are **unable to access the Domains API**
- ✅ **Accounts with 10 or more domains** have access with a monthly usage limit of 20,000 API calls

This explains the `403 Forbidden - Authenticated user is not allowed access` error.

## Why This Happened

Even though your API credentials are valid, GoDaddy blocks API access for accounts with fewer than 10 domains to protect against abuse and ensure system availability.

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Terraform Configuration

We can create Terraform configurations manually based on your domain list:

1. **Provide your domain list** and I'll create Terraform configurations
2. **Use Terraform data sources** to reference GoDaddy domains
3. **Migrate DNS to Cloudflare** where we have full API access
4. **Update nameservers** in GoDaddy to point to Cloudflare

### Option 2: Use GoDaddy's Web Console

Since Terraform import isn't available:
1. Use GoDaddy's web console to manage DNS
2. Export DNS records manually (if possible)
3. Manually configure initial Cloudflare settings
4. Then manage everything via Cloudflare API going forward

### Option 3: Focus on Cloudflare Migration

Since we have full Cloudflare API access:
1. Skip GoDaddy API integration entirely
2. Manually add DNS records in Cloudflare's web console
3. Use Terraform to manage them going forward
4. Much better experience than GoDaddy's API

## Recommended Approach

**I recommend Option 3**: Focus on Cloudflare migration directly

### Benefits:
- ✅ Full API access with no domain limits
- ✅ Better Terraform provider
- ✅ Better DNS management
- ✅ Free SSL certificates
- ✅ Better performance

### Migration Steps:
1. You provide list of GoDaddy domains you want to migrate
2. I create Cloudflare zone configurations in Terraform
3. You update nameservers in GoDaddy to point to Cloudflare
4. DNS records are managed via Terraform going forward
5. Eventually move websites to Cloudflare Pages (free hosting)

## What We Need From You

To proceed with manual configuration and Cloudflare migration:

1. **List of GoDaddy domains** you want to migrate to Cloudflare
2. **Current DNS records** for each domain (or I can help you list them)
3. **Target configuration** - what should each domain point to?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
