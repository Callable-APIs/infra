# GoDaddy API Status - Final Summary

## Current Situation

### Test Results
- ✅ OTE (Sandbox) API: **Working perfectly** (200 OK responses)
- ❌ Production API: **Still returning 403 ACCESS_DENIED**

### What We've Tried
1. ✅ Created OTE test key - works perfectly
2. ✅ Exercised OTE API extensively (25+ successful calls)
3. ✅ Created first production key - got 403
4. ✅ Created second production key - still 403
5. Verified authentication is valid (not 401 auth errors)

### The 403 Access Denied Meaning
This is **NOT** an authentication issue. The credentials are valid but the account lacks permission to access the API. This could be due to:
- GoDaddy account type restrictions
- Undisclosed API access requirements
- Regional restrictions
- Account verification requirements

## Conclusion

**GoDaddy's Production API is not accessible with the current account setup**, despite:
- Valid credentials
- Extensive OTE sandbox testing
- Multiple production key attempts

## Recommendation: Skip GoDaddy API

Since Terraform needs reliable API access and GoDaddy is not cooperating, the best approach is:

### Option 1: Direct Cloudflare Migration (Recommended)
1. Manually add domains to Cloudflare via web console initially
2. Use Terraform Cloudflare provider for ongoing management
3. Point GoDaddy nameservers to Cloudflare
4. All future DNS management via Terraform

### Option 2: Manual Terraform Configuration
1. You provide domain list and DNS records
2. I create Terraform configurations manually
3. Update GoDaddy nameservers to point to Cloudflare
4. Manage via Terraform going forward

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. Keep GoDaddy for domain registration
2. Use Cloudflare for DNS management (better API)
3. Terraform manages Cloudflare DNS
4. No need to touch GoDaddy API

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Help you add domains to Cloudflare manually?
2. Create Terraform configurations based on manual input?
3. Focus on other infrastructure tasks?

The GoDaddy API path appears blocked, but we have excellent alternatives via Cloudflare.
