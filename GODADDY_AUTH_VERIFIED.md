# GoDaddy API Authentication Verified

## Test Results

✅ **Authentication is working correctly**
- Wrong auth formats return `401 MISSING_CREDENTIALS` ✓
- Standard `sso-key` format returns `403 ACCESS_DENIED` (not auth error)
- This means **credentials are valid** but **account lacks permission**

## What This Means

The `403 ACCESS_DENIED` error indicates:
- ✅ Your API key and secret are correctly formatted
- ✅ Authentication is successful  
- ❌ Your GoDaddy account doesn't have permission to access the API

## Possible Reasons

1. **Account Type/Restrictions**: Some GoDaddy account types may not have API access
2. **Domain Count**: While not documented, there may be undisclosed restrictions
3. **API Key Permissions**: The key may have been created without proper permissions
4. **Account Verification**: Account may need additional verification or approval

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Contact GoDaddy Support
Ask GoDaddy support directly:
- "Why am I getting 403 ACCESS_DENIED when using the API?"
- "Do I need to enable API access on my account?"
- "Are there any restrictions on my account that prevent API usage?"

### Option 2: Use Terraform Without Import
Since we can't access the API, we can:
1. Manually list your domains from GoDaddy web console
2. Provide DNS records manually
3. Create Terraform configurations based on manual input
4. Use Terraform to manage via Cloudflare instead

### Option 3: Skip GoDaddy API Entirely
Focus on Cloudflare migration:
- Point domains to Cloudflare nameservers
- Manage everything via Terraform using Cloudflare provider
- Much better experience than GoDaddy API

## Recommendation

Since GoDaddy's API is proving difficult to access, I recommend **Option 3**: 
- Skip trying to manage GoDaddy via API
- Migrate DNS to Cloudflare where we have full access
- Manage everything via Terraform with Cloudflare provider
