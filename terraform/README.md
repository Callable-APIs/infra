# Terraform Infrastructure Configuration

This directory contains Terraform configurations generated from your current AWS infrastructure.

## Directory Structure

```

└── environments/         # Environment-specific configurations
    └── production/       # Production environment
```

## Generated Files

The following files are automatically generated by the AWS Infrastructure Reporting Tool:

- **main.tf**: Contains all discovered AWS resources
- **variables.tf**: Variable definitions for customization
- **outputs.tf**: Output values for referencing
- **providers.tf**: AWS provider configuration

## Usage

### 1. Initialize Terraform

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
```

### 2. Review the Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

This will show you what changes Terraform would make to match your current infrastructure.

### 3. Apply Configuration (Optional)

```bash
terraform apply
```

**Note**: Only run `terraform apply` if you want to manage your infrastructure with Terraform going forward.

## Important Notes

- **This is a generated configuration** based on your current AWS infrastructure
- **Review all resources** before applying to ensure they match your requirements
- **Some resources may need manual adjustment** for proper Terraform management
- **State management**: Consider using remote state storage (S3 + DynamoDB) for production use

## Customization

You can customize the generated configuration by:

1. **Editing variables.tf** to add your own variables
2. **Modifying main.tf** to adjust resource configurations
3. **Adding modules** in the modules/ directory for reusable components
4. **Creating environment-specific configs** in environments/

## Security Considerations

- **Never commit sensitive data** like API keys or passwords
- **Use Terraform variables** for environment-specific values
- **Consider using AWS Secrets Manager** for sensitive configuration
- **Review IAM policies** generated for your resources

## Next Steps

1. Review the generated configuration
2. Test with `terraform plan` to ensure it matches your current state
3. Set up remote state storage for team collaboration
4. Create environment-specific configurations
5. Implement CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure changes

## Support

For issues with the generated configuration:
1. Check the AWS Infrastructure Reporting Tool logs
2. Review AWS documentation for specific resources
3. Consult Terraform documentation for syntax issues
