# GoDaddy API Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ API Key and Secret are loaded in environment
- ❌ Getting `403 Forbidden - Authenticated user is not allowed access`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Production vs Development Environment
The API credentials might be created for the wrong environment.

**Check**: Go to https://developer.godaddy.com/keys/ and verify:
- The key is marked as **"Production"**
- You created a new key, not used an old development key

**Solution**: Create a new Production API key if needed.

### 2. API Key Permissions
The key might not have the necessary permissions for DNS access.

**Check**: The key should have permissions for:
- DNS management
- Domain access

**Solution**: Create a new key with full permissions or ensure DNS permissions are enabled.

### 3. Wait for Propagation
New API keys may take a few minutes to propagate.

**Solution**: Wait 5-10 minutes after creating the key before trying again.

### 4. Alternative: Use GoDaddy Console
If API access continues to fail, we can use the GoDaddy console directly:

1. Log into your GoDaddy account
2. Navigate to DNS management for each domain
3. Manually list the domains and DNS records
4. We'll create Terraform configurations based on that information

## Next Steps

1. **Verify API Key Settings**:
   - Go to https://developer.godaddy.com/keys/
   - Confirm environment is "Production"
   - Confirm key has DNS/Domain permissions

2. **Try Testing Again**:
   ```bash
   source env.sh
   curl -X GET "https://api.godaddy.com/v1/domains?limit=10" \
     -H "Authorization: sso-key $GODADDY_API_KEY:$GODADDY_API_SECRET" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
   ```

3. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Use GoDaddy web console to export DNS records
   - Manually provide domain list
   - I'll create Terraform configurations based on the list

## Manual Domain Discovery

If API continues to fail, please provide:
1. List of domain names in your GoDaddy account
2. List of DNS records for each domain

Then I can:
1. Create Terraform data sources for each domain
2. Set up DNS record resources
3. Import them into Terraform state
