# CallableAPIs Practical Migration Plan: us-east-1/2 → us-west-2

## 🎯 **Migration Goals**
- Preserve existing application and deployment pipeline
- Consolidate to us-west-2 (Oregon) for better performance
- Minimize downtime and risk
- Maintain current functionality

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

### Existing Infrastructure:
- **us-east-1**: Elastic Beanstalk environment (CallableapisServiceEnv-env)
  - Instance: `i-0b42968767491c3c9` (t2.micro)
  - Public IP: `35.170.87.155`
  - Status: Active, serving traffic
  - Cost: $0.28/day

- **us-east-2**: Old instance (standalone)
  - Instance: `i-0aaa66e426e07bcd4` (t2.micro)
  - Public IP: `18.191.248.15`
  - Status: Active, serving API traffic
  - Cost: $0.28/day (unnecessary expense)

### Current DNS Routing:
- `callableapis.com` → `35.170.87.155` (us-east-1)
- `www.callableapis.com` → `35.170.87.155` (us-east-1)
- `api.callableapis.com` → `18.191.248.15` (us-east-2)

## 🚀 **Migration Strategy**

### Phase 1: Prepare us-west-2 Infrastructure
1. **Create Elastic Beanstalk environment in us-west-2**
   - Use same configuration as us-east-1
   - Deploy existing application code
   - Test functionality

2. **Create standalone instance in us-west-2** (if needed)
   - Replace the old us-east-2 instance
   - Configure same services
   - Test API functionality

### Phase 2: DNS Cutover
1. **Update Route53 records**
   - Point all domains to us-west-2 resources
   - Use short TTL for quick rollback if needed

2. **Monitor and test**
   - Verify all functionality works
   - Check performance improvements

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. **Terminate old resources**
   - us-east-1 Elastic Beanstalk environment
   - us-east-2 standalone instance
   - Associated EBS volumes and Elastic IPs

## 💰 **Cost Analysis**

### Current Monthly Cost:
- us-east-1: $0.28/day = $8.40/month
- us-east-2: $0.28/day = $8.40/month
- **Total: $16.80/month**

### After Migration:
- us-west-2: $0.28/day = $8.40/month
- **Total: $8.40/month**
- **Savings: $8.40/month ($100.80/year)**

## 🛠️ **Implementation Steps**

### Step 1: Create us-west-2 Terraform Configuration
```bash
# Create Elastic Beanstalk environment in us-west-2
# Create standalone instance in us-west-2
# Configure networking and security groups
```

### Step 2: Deploy Application
```bash
# Deploy existing application to us-west-2
# Test all functionality
# Verify performance
```

### Step 3: Update DNS
```bash
# Update Route53 records to point to us-west-2
# Monitor DNS propagation
# Test all endpoints
```

### Step 4: Cleanup
```bash
# Terminate old us-east-1 and us-east-2 resources
# Verify cost reduction
# Update documentation
```

## 🔧 **Terraform Configuration**

### us-west-2 Elastic Beanstalk Environment
- Same configuration as us-east-1
- t2.micro instance type
- Auto-scaling group
- Load balancer
- Security groups

### us-west-2 Standalone Instance
- t2.micro instance type
- Same configuration as us-east-2
- Security groups
- EBS volume

### DNS Updates
- Update Route53 records
- Point to new us-west-2 resources
- Maintain same domain structure

## 📋 **Rollback Plan**

If issues occur:
1. **Immediate rollback**: Update DNS back to us-east-1/2
2. **Investigate issues**: Debug us-west-2 configuration
3. **Fix and retry**: Address issues and retry migration

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

- [ ] All domains resolve to us-west-2
- [ ] Application functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance improved (lower latency)
- [ ] Cost reduced by 50%
- [ ] Old resources terminated
- [ ] No downtime during migration

## 📊 **Expected Benefits**

1. **Performance**: Lower latency from California
2. **Cost**: 50% reduction in monthly costs
3. **Simplicity**: Single region deployment
4. **Maintenance**: Easier to manage single region
5. **Scalability**: Better region for future growth

## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

1. **Backup**: Ensure application code is backed up
2. **Testing**: Thoroughly test us-west-2 deployment
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor during and after migration
4. **Rollback**: Keep old resources until migration is confirmed successful
5. **Documentation**: Update all documentation with new IPs/endpoints
