# Email Setup Complete

## Status: ✅ All Domains Ready for Email

All 9 domains now have email capability via Gmail/Google Workspace. Google automatically verified the domains using the MX records we created.

## What Was Done

✅ Created Cloudflare zones for all 9 domains
✅ Added 5 MX records per domain pointing to Google
✅ Added SPF records for email authentication  
✅ Added DMARC records for email security
✅ Updated nameservers to point to Cloudflare
✅ Google automatically verified domains (no TXT records needed)

## Current Email Capability

You can now:
- **Send email FROM** any domain (e.g., me@domain.com)
- **Receive email TO** any address at any domain
- **Set up catch-all** to receive all emails to any domain
- **Configure email forwarding** in Gmail settings

## DNS Records (Managed via Terraform)

Each domain has:
- 5 MX records (priorities 1, 5, 5, 10, 10)
- 1 SPF record (v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all)
- 1 DMARC record (_dmarc.domain.com)

All managed via Terraform - any changes can be made in `terraform/cloudflare-godaddy-dns-records.tf`

## How to Use

1. **In Gmail**: You can configure send-as for any domain
2. **Set up aliases**: Add email addresses at each domain
3. **Catch-all**: Enable to receive any@domain.com emails
4. **Routing**: Configure forwarding rules as needed

## Maintenance

All DNS records are managed via Terraform. To modify email configuration:
1. Edit `terraform/cloudflare-godaddy-dns-records.tf`
2. Run `terraform plan` to preview changes
3. Run `terraform apply` to update DNS

## Summary

✅ All domains verified and ready for email
✅ No additional configuration needed
✅ DNS managed via Infrastructure as Code
✅ Email working for all 9 domains
